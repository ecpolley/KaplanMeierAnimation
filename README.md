The animation file demonstrates the redistribute-to-the-right algorithm (Efron, 1967). The algorithm is a way to think about the Kaplan-Meier estimator for right censored data.

The main file is `RedistToRight.ani.R` containing the function of the same name. The function uses the animation package (links: [cran][cran], [wiki][wiki] and [github][github]). The file `animate.R` contains details on how to compile the animation in various formats. `Redistribute.pdf` is an example pdf containing the animation.
